              I started my career in Textile Engineering, where I learned to think in terms of processes, constraints, and system stability. That mindset eventually pulled me toward IT—first through self-study in hardware, operating systems, networking, and cloud basics, and then through real-world roles supporting schools and managing web-hosting infrastructure for small businesses. Over the past three years, I've maintained mixed Windows/Linux environments, led zero-downtime server migrations, automated backups and lab setups, and helped non-technical users navigate complex systems. Now, as a Master's graduate in Computer Science & Information Technology, I focus on cloud infrastructure, automation, and system reliability—building solutions that are practical, documented, and designed to scale.

          <div class="about__story">
            <button class="about__toggle" id="story-toggle">Read my full story</button>
            
            <div class="about__full-story" id="full-story">
              <p>I didn't start in computer science. I began in Textile Engineering in Bangladesh, working with processes, quality, and systems that had to run reliably every day. That environment trained me to think in terms of constraints, repeatability, and cause-and-effect—skills that turned out to be just as relevant to IT as they were to manufacturing.</p>
              
              <p>Over time, I noticed my curiosity shifting away from materials and production and toward the logic behind systems and software. I wanted to understand how networks route requests, how servers stay online, and how different layers of infrastructure interact. That curiosity pushed me into late nights of self-study: basics of programming, operating systems, networking, and eventually cloud platforms. I didn't have a formal CS background yet, so I built one for myself—through online courses, labs, and small experiments.</p>
              
              <p>That work led to my first professional opportunities in IT in Bangladesh. At a local school, I became the person responsible for keeping devices, printers, and networks running for the staff. It was a crash course in real-world support: diagnosing issues under time pressure, explaining solutions to non-technical users, and making sure everything worked when it needed to.</p>
              
              <p>From there, I moved into a broader infrastructure role at a web-hosting and IT services provider for small businesses. I managed hybrid Windows/Linux servers, tuned web-hosting stacks, led server migrations with zero downtime, and built documentation and standard operating procedures so systems wouldn't depend on "tribal knowledge." I also automated repetitive tasks like backups and lab setups, cutting manual work and reducing the room for human error.</p>
              
              <p>As my responsibilities grew, it became clear that this wasn't just a side interest—I wanted to go deeper into computer science and cloud infrastructure. That decision brought me to the United States to pursue a Master's in Computer Science & Information Technology at Sacred Heart University. Coming from a non-CS undergraduate background meant rebuilding my foundation: algorithms, data structures, software engineering, security, and cloud architecture. It wasn't comfortable, but it was consistent with how I've always approached change—by doing the work, step by step, until the gap closes.</p>
              
              <p>During my graduate studies, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for cloud computing labs, helping students understand AWS concepts like VPC, EC2, IAM, and S3. I supported them through lab issues and also automated parts of the lab environment using Python and AWS CLI, reducing setup time and improving reliability. That role reinforced how much I enjoy working at the infrastructure layer—where clarity, documentation, and stable systems directly impact other people's work.</p>
              
              <p>Today, I bring together three threads: the process discipline from textile engineering, the hands-on experience of managing real production systems, and a formal CS background focused on cloud and automation. I'm interested in roles where I can design, maintain, and improve systems—whether that's cloud infrastructure, DevOps tooling, or reliable backend services. My path hasn't been linear, but it has been intentional: identify what I want to understand, learn it deeply, apply it in practice, and keep building from there.</p>
